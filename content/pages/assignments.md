Assignment One: Comprehension Exercise
--------------------------------------

10% of grade  
Due in week four

Consider the paragraph in 'On Sense and Reference' which starts "It may be tempting to regard the relation of a proposition to the True not as that of sense to reference, but as that of subject to predicate" (pp. 202-3 in Martinich)

1\. In your **own** words, explain what Frege is saying here. Give what background is necessary to make sense of his concerns. You should devote around two pages to this task.

2\. Say, very briefly, whether you think that Frege's comments here are satisfactory. If you have a concrete objection, present it concisely. (If you have more than one, just give what you take to be the most decisive.) Don't devote more than a page to this task.

Assignment Two: Critical Note
-----------------------------

10% of grade  
Due in week eight

In the third lecture of _Naming and Necessity_, Kripke argues that his account of the semantics of singular and natural kind terms shows the falsity of the identity theory of mental states.

The task for this assignment is to outline Kripke's argument, and to critically assess it. As before, you have around three pages (up to 1200 words). But this time the focus of your discussion should be on the criticism. If you can, take it one stage further: consider how Kripke might respond to your initial criticism, and how you might counter that.

You may concentrate on either the token-token identity theory, or the type-type identity theory; you do not need to discuss both.

Assignment Three: Short Paper

Papers should be around eight pages (3000-4000 words) long. I have given a list of readings for each paper, but there is, of course, much more available. See me if you want more readings on specific topics.
